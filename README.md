# Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for Financial Time Series

Nowadays, the emergence of Machine Learning and more recently Deep Learning has brought a new dimension to the theory of time series. Indeed, Deep learning methods offer many promises for time series forecasting, such as the automatic learning of time dependence and automatic management of time structures (trends and seasonality).

In this project, implementing the attached arXiv paper, I will present to you the different avenues explored concerning the development of a prototype using a recurrent neural network LSTM for the prediction of the evolution of stock prices.
